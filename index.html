            <h1>Flowers bloom early in New York City</h1>

       <p>Spring is now in full bloom in New York City, but signs of spring were taking over well before the equinox. If every year, you wonder whether it's too early to be seeing these early spring blooms, urban ecologist Peter Del Tredici at Harvard says you are not alone. </p>
        
        <p>“It's not your imagination, that's for sure,” said Del Tredici. “Over the past 100 years or so, on average flowering times have moved up about two weeks.”</p>
        
        <p>The shifting of natural cycles is due a combination of climate change and the urban heat island effect making cities warmer all year round. </p>
        
        <p>And if cities are warmer, biological activity like flowers sprouting happens earlier.</p>
        
        <p>The tracking of natural cycles is called phenology. New York City’s phenological data is not extensive when it comes to plants, but citizen scientists are filling in some gaps by uploading their observations to apps like iNaturalist.</p> 
        
        <p>This map includes some information on a few early-spring flowers found in Prospect Park and information on when they were spotted this year. </p>
